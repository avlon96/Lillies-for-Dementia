                 <p>Most Healthcare professionals explain Dementia in 3 stages: mild (or “early”), 
                   moderate (or “middle”), and severe (or “late”). Which explains how far a person has
                   progressed. More specific stages of Dementia are broken down by symptoms. Its also helpful 
                   to monitor how symptoms change. That is also how stages can progress as well.

        Stage 1 of dementia can also be classified as the normal functioning stage. At this stage of dementia 
        development, a patient generally does not exhibit any significant problems with memory, or any cognitive 
        impairment. People with NO dementia would be considered to be in Stage 1. Stages 1-3 of dementia progression 
        are generally known as "pre-dementia" stages.

      <div class="card-body">
        This stage features occasional lapses of memory most frequently seen in:
        <br/>
        <br/>
•	Forgetting where one has placed an object
<br/>
•	Forgetting names that were once very familiar
<br/>
<br/>
Oftentimes, this mild decline in memory is merely normal age-related cognitive decline, but it can also be one of 
the earliest signs of degenerative dementia. At this stage, signs are still virtually undetectable through clinical 
testing. Concern for early onset of dementia should arise with respect to other symptoms. Some elder over the age of
65 live at this level the rest of their life with some form of mild forgetfulness.

        This stage includes increased forgetfulness, slight difficulty concentrating, and decreased work performance. 
        People may get lost more frequently or have difficulty finding the right words. At this stage, a person’s loved 
        ones will begin to notice a cognitive decline. Patients often start to experience mild to moderate anxiety as 
        these symptoms increasingly interfere with day to day life.

        In stage 4 dementia, individuals have no trouble recognizing familiar faces or traveling to familiar locations.

        or anxiety. This stage includes difficulty concentrating, decreased memory of recent events, and difficulties managing 
        finances or traveling alone to new locations. People have trouble completing complex tasks efficiently or accurately
         and may be in denial about their symptoms. They may also start withdrawing from family or friends because socialization 
         becomes difficult. At this stage, a physician can detect clear cognitive problems during a patient interview and exam.
