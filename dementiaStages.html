                 <p>Most Healthcare professionals explain Dementia in 3 stages: mild (or “early”), 
                   moderate (or “middle”), and severe (or “late”). Which explains how far a person has
                   progressed. More specific stages of Dementia are broken down by symptoms. Its also helpful 
                   to monitor how symptoms change. That is also how stages can progress as well.

               <p>Stage 1 of dementia can also be classified as the normal functioning stage. At this stage of dementia 
        development, a patient generally does not exhibit any significant problems with memory, or any cognitive 
        impairment. People with NO dementia would be considered to be in Stage 1. Stages 1-3 of dementia progression 
        are generally known as "pre-dementia" stages.</p>

          65 live at this level the rest of their life with some form of mild forgetfulness.

         and may be in denial about their symptoms. They may also start withdrawing from family or friends because socialization
